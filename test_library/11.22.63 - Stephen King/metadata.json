  "description": "<b>THE #1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER AND MODERN CLASSIC FROM MASTER STORYTELLER STEPHEN KING</b><br /> <br /><b>A <i>NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW </i>TOP TEN BOOK OF THE YEAR</b><br /> <br /><b>WINNER OF THE <i>LOS ANGELES TIMES </i>BOOK PRIZE</b><br /><br /><b>On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King—who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer—takes readers on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it.</b><br /><br />It begins with Jake Epping, a thirty-five-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, whose life is upended when his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And the dying Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in the world of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere and to the small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love. Every turn leads eventually to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful, and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable. Or so terrifying.",
